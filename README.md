# CaesarCipher
A simple Javascript implementation of a Caesar Cipher.

How to run this program?
Currently, it is one file, an html file to be loaded by file url in your browser
(Chrome and Firefox were the only two tested).  From there, enter an enciphered text,
such as "JUM" without the quotes, which will show a table with "DOG" as the deciphered text
on the row labeled 6, among other possible deciphers.

What is a Caesar Cipher?
In simplest terms, the shift cipher is the cryptography method allegedly used by Julius Caesar himself.
It works by taking an alphabet, and shifting each letter to another letter, by a fixed number
(e.g., you shift one letter, so A becomes B, B becomes C, etc.).  Think of Ralph's decoder ring on "Christmas Story"
for a better visual and how it loops to account for shifting under A and over Z.

What does this project do?
Currently, it only supports deciphering a string.  
However, it will show a list of the string deciphered from 0 letters shifted to 30 letters shifted
(arguably, you can tweak the first for loop in the algorithm to show any number of letters shifted to the right).

Why was this project made?
As a helpful, simple cryptography tool or demonstration, for cybersecurity lovers.
It also helped to challenge time-constrained Javascript coding to solve a problem
(This took me less than an hour).

**DISCLAIMER: Any codes cracked with this method is at the risk of the user.  However, the user should let
the owner of the Caesar Cipher know that this Antiquity Cryptography is antiquated.
